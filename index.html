          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure
          a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
          within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
          and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a
          basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

        <header>So what is HTML?</header>
        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
          wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
          or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image
          hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font
          bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
          content:
        </p>
        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <p>
          If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
          a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>

        <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>

        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this
            case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states
            where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case
            where the paragraph begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it
            includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where
            the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to
            add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can
            lead to strange results.
          </li>
          <li>
            The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case,
            is just text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content
            together comprise the element.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"

          width="1287"
          height="156"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <p>
          Imagen de
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics"
            >Mozilla Developer Network</a
          >
          bajo licencia
          <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"
            >CC-BY-SA 3.0</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't
          want to appear in the actual content. Here,
          <span class="gray">class</span> is the attribute name and
          <span class="gray">editor-note</span> is the attribute value. The
          <span class="gray">class</span> attribute allows you to give the
          element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any
          other elements with the same <span class="gray">class</span> value)
          with style information and other things. Some attributes have no
          value, such as <span class="gray">required</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute,
            if the element already has one or more attributes).
          </li>
          <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>
            The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
        <header>Nesting elements</header>
        <p>
          You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
          nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could
          wrap the word "very" in a
          <span class="gray">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element, which means that the
          word is to be strongly emphasized:
        </p>
        <code>
          <span class="gray">&lt;p&gt;</span>My cat is
          &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly
          nested. In the example above, we opened the
          <span class="gray">&lt;p&gt;</span> element first, then the
          <span class="gray">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element; therefore, we have
          to close the <span class="gray">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element first,
          then the <span class="gray">&lt;p&gt;</span> element. The following is
          incorrect:
        </p>
        <code class="vinotinto">
          &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly
          inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then
          your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were
          trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Void_elements">
        <header>Void elements</header>
        <p>
          Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the
          <span class="gray">&lt;img&gt;</span> element that we already have in
          our HTML page:
        </p>
        <code>
          &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          This contains two attributes, but there is no closing
          <span class="gray">&lt;/img&gt;</span> tag and no inner content. This
          is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its
          purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document"></section>
      <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
      <p>
        That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't
        handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are
        combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into
        our <span class="gray">index.html</span> example (which we first met in
        the Dealing with files article):
      </p>
      <code style="white-space: pre-wrap">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta
        charset="utf-8" /&gt; &lt;meta name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width" /&gt; &lt;title&gt;My test
        page&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;img
        src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
      </code>
      <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="gray">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
          — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML
          was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a
          set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good
          HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful
          things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just
          needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you
          need to know for now.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gray">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span>
          — the <span class="gray">&lt;html&gt;</span> element. This element
          wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the
          root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary
          language of the document.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gray">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span> — the
          <span class="gray">&lt;head&gt;</span> element. This element acts as a
          container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that
          isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This
          includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to
          appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set
          declarations, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gray">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span> — This element
          sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which
          includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.
          Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on
          it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some
          problems later on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gray"
            >&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</span
          >
          — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of
          viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than
          the viewport and then shrinking them down.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gray">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span> — the
          <span class="gray">&lt;title&gt;</span> element. This sets the title
          of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the
          page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you
          bookmark/favorite it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gray">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span> — the
          <span class="gray">&lt;body&gt;</span> element. This contains all the
          content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page,
          whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or
          whatever else.
